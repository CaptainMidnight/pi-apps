The best vector graphics image editor for Raspberry Pi.
Finally, the full version of Boxy SVG has arrived! This installs the Boxy SVG offline Chrome App onto your existing Chromium Browser.
Performance is excellent, and I (Botspot) have been using it on my RPi for for all graphics editing. (Ingluding the Pi-Apps logo!)

If you have a problem using Boxy SVG, please report it on Botspot's github page. Not to the Boxy SVG website! If there's too many RPi-based bug reports of complaints, the Boxy SVG dev may withdraw his permission for it to be on Pi-Apps, and nobody wants that to happen.

Shout-out to ItzCutePikachu for figuring out how to remove the annoying "Boxy SVG will stop working" pop-up from the javascript.
